# Digital-twin-night-health-monitoring
This repository contains a simulation-based implementation of a Digital Twin IoT system
for personalized, non-clinical night-time health monitoring.

## Project Type
Simulation-Based Project

## Description
The system simulates night-time physiological data (heart rate and SpO₂),
builds a personalized digital twin baseline, detects abnormal events,
and generates interpretable monitoring outputs including visualizations
and a morning summary report.

## Repository Contents
- Python simulation notebook
- Generated physiological datasets
- Event detection results
